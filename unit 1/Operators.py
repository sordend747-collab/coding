# Operator
# Operators are a construct (built in system) that give data types more actions and power.

# Arithmetic Operator Family
# Arithmetic operators are simply math operations

print(2 + 4) # additon operator
print (10 - 10) # Subtraction operator
print (2/1) # division operator
print (12 * 34) # multipliacation operator

# Assianment Operator Family
# These operators assign vaules to
# varibles(otherwise known as containers)
# Key / Vaule pairs

Schoolname = "Boys Latin"
age = 16
username = "mevsyou"
password = "12345"
location = "123.123456.2345"
search = "pizza"

age += 2 # adding a new vaule to our variable
age *= 3 # multiplying a new vaule to our varible.

print(2!=3) # not the same 

Print("123Abc" == "123Avbc") # double equal signs mean its compearing the vaules are "the SAME" 

# logical Operator family  it check and compears if certain code conditions are true or false

print(3 > 1 and "shawn" == "shawn")  # This will remain True

# the and operator checks to see both condition are true, if both are true the answer is true.
# the not operator will give the oppisite result.
