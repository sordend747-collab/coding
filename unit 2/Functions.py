# Function - Is a set of code instructions labeld under 
# A coustume name that the computer will run.

# Function Syntax (Rules of how its written)
# Function have 2 phases: Function defenition and Function call.

# Function definition.
# We are describing the instruction for our code 
# We are addeing logic to the computers vocabulary.
# This code does not run- it only gives the computer the meaning not the action.

Example

def example():
    Print('good morning')# 1 instruction: print good morning

# Phase 2: Function call
# Once we make the definitive, we can now run the instructions
# by writing the fumction name.

Example()

def example():
    print('good day')
    a = input(' enter a number:')
    print(a)
